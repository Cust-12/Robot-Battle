Robot Battle

There are 4 different classes of robots with different stats. During each run, two robots are randomly chosen and will assign a specific type of weapon to themselves based off the stats of the opposing robot.

If the enemy has armor greater than 50 points, the robot should use Laser. If the armor is between 20 and 50 points, Rifle is good enough. If the armor is less than 20, Spear is the one to pick. The speed of the enemy should also be taken into consideration when picking a weapon. If the enemyâ€™s speed is faster than 60km/h, Spear will not yield any damage. If the enemy moves faster than 120km/h, the only effective weapon will be Laser.

Use the interface.java file in order to run the program.
